<p>WellSync is a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. With WellSync, patients will be able to record their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication and substance use, and other relevant health information on a daily basis. Selected information from patientsâ€™ health logs will be shared with their care providers, while keeping sensitive notes private to patients. Health care providers therefore have access to the history of their patientsâ€™ observations over time. They can use this information to curate their patientsâ€™ wellness goals, specify the symptoms they should be watching for, and communicate advice. Patients will then see their WellSync experience adapt as their practitioner follows along and responds to their health updates.

<p>WellSync is a health and wellness tracker that allows patients and their healthcare providers to plan treatments and monitor progress together.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wellsync"><a class="header" href="#what-is-wellsync">What is WellSync?</a></h2>
<p>WellSync is a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. With WellSync, patients will be able to record their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication and substance use, and other relevant health information on a daily basis. Selected information from patientsâ€™ health logs will be shared with their care providers, while keeping sensitive notes private to patients. Health care providers therefore have access to the history of their patientsâ€™ observations over time.

Patients will then see their WellSync experience adapt as their practitioner follows along and responds to their health updates.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-solution-valuable"><a class="header" href="#why-is-this-solution-valuable">Why is this solution valuable?</a></h2>
<p>WellSync encourages a collaborative approach to health care delivery by keeping both patients and practitioners engaged at all stages of a patientâ€™s treatment and recovery journey. Communicating through a wellness journal benefits both sides of the health care relationship by eliminating the need for an in-person appointment to share simple condition updates. Also, care providers can consult their patientsâ€™ history of daily health observations to make more informed decisions when planning treatments and giving advice. Having a consistent and daily record of patientsâ€™ conditions stored in WellSync is a notable improvement compared to relying on verbal reports, which are only shared at each appointment. Further, patients will find value in referring to their past reports to better understand their own condition and how it has evolved over time.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-success-mean-for-us"><a class="header" href="#what-does-success-mean-for-us">What does success mean for us?</a></h2>
<p>WellSync improves on traditional health care delivery models by providing a means of professional, private communication between patients and health care providers outside of the physical clinical environment. After adopting WellSync in their clinics, practitioners and their support staff should be spending less time on searching through charts to retrieve patient health information, and on updating charts with new developments. Patients will also be saving time by using WellSync to communicate with their care providers, rather than attending frequent medical appointments. Any patient whose care provider is following their wellness journey with WellSync should report increased satisfaction with the health care they receive, and increased awareness of the important factors influencing their well-being. These two metrics can easily be assessed by user surveys administered by clinics before and after introducing WellSync in their practice. Overall, using WellSync to record and communicate patient well-being will make the health care experience easier, more accessible, and more informative for both practitioners and patients.</p>

<p>WellSync is a user-friendly application allowing patients to keep track of their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication use and substance use on a daily basis. Patients do not need any technical knowledge to start using WellSync to communicate with their healthcare providers. Our efficient solution to healthcare record-keeping and communication benefits patients of all ages and walks of life. Patients with busy schedules, who have trouble finding time to visit and correspond with their healthcare provider, would benefit most from our solution. WellSync is also ideal for patients who prefer a regimented, data-driven approach to managing their health, since our solution works best when patients engage by completing their health logs daily.</p>
<h3 id="doctors"><a class="header" href="#doctors">Doctors:</a></h3>
<p>WellSync equips healthcare providers with tools for faster patient communication and daily access to patient health information. This solution is ideal for any medical practice seeking to modernize their operations, by reducing paper records and eliminating the need to arrange in-person appointments for simple status updates. Our solution is particularly effective when managing conditions that require frequent check-ins with the patient, since we encourage patients to fill out their wellness log every day. If you or your practice frequently deal with such issues, and are having difficulty keeping in touch regularly with patients, WellSync might be for you.</p>

<h3 id="hung-lu-dao---the-commit-master"><a class="header" href="#hung-lu-dao---the-commit-master">Hung Lu Dao - The Commit Master</a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For the project, I learned that the fundamentals of Android app
development is crucial. This includes learning Java programming language
and Android SDK (Software Development Kit) which includes libraries, tools
and APIs for building Android applications. In addition, I also learned about user interface (UI) design principles
which is important for creating visually appealing and intuitive Android applications. This involves understanding
layouts, widget, navigation patterns, and designing interfaces that are easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="alvee-jawad---i-forgot-my-workout-shoes-in-class-so-im-gonna-walk-in-on-the-class-taking-a-test-thats-right-after-our-class-they-were-at-home"><a class="header" href="#alvee-jawad---i-forgot-my-workout-shoes-in-class-so-im-gonna-walk-in-on-the-class-taking-a-test-thats-right-after-our-class-they-were-at-home">Alvee Jawad - "I forgot my workout shoes in class, so I'm gonna walk in on the class (taking a test) that's right after our class (they were at home)"</a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  My experience for this project has been a great experience as I had an
amazing group that was able to support me as I had no experience early on. I was able to write some unit tests
(using Mockito) and acceptance/system tests as well as code methods in the logic layer.</p>
<h3 id="camila-martinez-ovando---the-ui-empress-in-flesh"><a class="header" href="#camila-martinez-ovando---the-ui-empress-in-flesh">Camila Martinez Ovando - The UI empress in flesh</a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I helped with the UI design and improved my skills in crafting intuitive and
visually appealing user interfaces. This journey led me to familiarize myself with XML files, define layouts and
structure content efficiently within Android Studio. Also, this project has not only sharpened my technical skills but
has also equipped me with invaluable soft skills, working within a team setting across various iterations has improved my
understanding of agile methodologies, emphasizing adaptability, accountability and communication for our project
success.</p>
<h3 id="muhammad-safdar---literally-the-database-himself--sqls-my-middle-name--sql-senior"><a class="header" href="#muhammad-safdar---literally-the-database-himself--sqls-my-middle-name--sql-senior">Muhammad Safdar - Literally the database himself / SQL's my middle name / SQL <em>Senior</em>?</a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Muhammad worked on the database layer for iteration one and two as well as
the logic layer for iteration three. Learning how to identify code smells and SOLID violations was something learned.
This project was a good way to practice being a part of a team as well as bringing their own skillset to the project.</p>
<h3 id="ryan-austria-velicaria---the-docu-logic-ian"><a class="header" href="#ryan-austria-velicaria---the-docu-logic-ian">Ryan Austria Velicaria - The docu-logic-ian</a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This project was a fantastic opportunity to learn a lot about building
software effectively.  I learned how to write acceptance tests, system tests, integration tests and unit tests as well
as incorporating SOLID principles into my coding. While I wrote some of the code for the logic layer of WellSync, I also
kept documentation (creating dev tasks and managing time spent/estimated) up-to-date with the iterations. Overall, this
project helped me learn a lot about both coding efficiently and effectively as well as working with a team.</p>
<h3 id="gabriel-young---probably-testing-code-right-now--the-error-eradicator-with-a-hint-of-a-superhero-vibe"><a class="header" href="#gabriel-young---probably-testing-code-right-now--the-error-eradicator-with-a-hint-of-a-superhero-vibe">Gabriel Young - <em>Probably testing code right now</em> / The Error Eradicator <em>(with a hint of a superhero vibe)</em></a></h3>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This project was a great exercise in designing (then following) a software
architecture model. I mostly worked on the application logic layer, which was good practice in writing self-contained
code that did not use any Android- or persistence-specific resources. I also got much practice with automated unit and
integration testing, using JUnit and Mockito, which was completely new to me. Other interesting challenges included
managing Gradle dependencies, and debugging our app on my own Android phone. It was a great learning experience overall!
there, changed it up a bit</p>

<p>This postmortem serves to recap the developmental process of the WellSync app, a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. It explores some positive and negative points on some issues that arose during the entire process of development.</p>
<h2 id="what-issues-arose"><a class="header" href="#what-issues-arose">What issues arose?</a></h2>
<h2 id="iteration-1"><a class="header" href="#iteration-1">Iteration 1</a></h2>
<p>An issue that arose during the first iteration of the development process was the last-minute production of the actual code. As the deadline seemed to have been forgotten by most members as well as the team still figuring out how to gel with each other, time seemed to have slipped by as testing happened the night before the deadline. This was not ideal as it caused stress to build up early on in the process. Although this experience wasn't the best start for the team, it did allow for team chemistry to build as well as allowing the team to get a good gist of what time is needed for the entire developmental process. Another area that suffered due to last-minute coding was documentation, as the time tracking for some dev tasks and user stories were forgotten and documented at the very last minute as well. Although this was not a big problem towards the end, it may have caused some inaccuracy in our project velocity calculations (although we corrected our mistakes retrospectively when planning for Iteration 2, wherever possible).</p>
<p>One final issue that should be mentioned is the branch naming convention. Due to conflicting difference in some branch naming conventions, the documentation for the project was hard to keep up with. At the end, our team decided to stick with the initials of the coder as well as the dev task number, for example, <code>rv/dev96</code>. That way, anyone in the team could tell what a branch was created for. Iteration 1 ended up focusing on three main features: Signing in as a patient, registering as a patient, and logging daily mood and sleep hours.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-2"><a class="header" href="#iteration-2">Iteration 2</a></h2>
<p>With Iteration 1 being the catapult that helped Iteration 2 get off to a good start, the team was able to properly distribute work as well as get work done for intermediate deadlines set by the team. By applying the different things learned in class such as techniques to reduce coupling and increase cohesion, addressing technical debt, and incorporating patterns such as the recycle view and the adapter pattern into our project; we were able to avoid code smells early on in our developmental process. As a team, we were able to find and fix certain SOLID violations found in Iteration 1. With that being said, an issue that still arose during developmental process for Iteration 2 was that a lot of SRP (Solid-Responsibility Principle) and DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) violations were still violated by our code by the end of Iteration 2. Although this was not the best feedback to receive as it indicated that we were not properly avoiding SOLID violations, it still is good feedback to receive as our eyes were opened for avoiding SOLID violations in Iteration 3, the final release.</p>
<p>Due to last minute implementations of the role property (to distinguish doctor and patient credentials), there were conflicting ideas of the functionality of the sign-in and log-in. One idea questioned whether a user should have to select their role when logging in, while others thought this information should be stored inside the database. Still, the team was able to find a solution and submit on time, although technical debt would arise due to this small issue. Iteration 2 focused on incorporating the substance-use tracker, medication tracker and the symptom tracker. In this iteration, our team also improved the patient homepage, and added the Doctor role (allowing users to log in / register as doctors and view their patients' information). To adhere to SOLID principles, our team decided to modify our architecture by having one overarching "daily log" object, instead of four distinct objects for the symptom, medication, substance-use and mood logs.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-3"><a class="header" href="#iteration-3">Iteration 3</a></h2>
<p>Shortly after Iteration 2, the team had a meeting on what the focus for Iteration 3 was going to be. One unanimous idea was that the code from Iteration 2 was in dire need of cleaning up. While the implementation for Iteration 2 was rushed, there was still code that had smells to it. An area that was needing of change was the hardcoding of some variables such as age, sex (a controversial topic for this project), etc. Another area for improvement was more extensive testing, since we did not check our test coverage again after adding some code shortly before the deadline. This caused our Iteration 2 logic layer to fall under 80% coverage, and some new persistence methods weren't reached by integration tests either. Another issue that was addressed was the documentation and how the time estimates were too off from the actual time spent between iterations. By reviewing each issue in GitLab, our team was able to fix this and provide decently accurate project velocities for Iterations 1 and 2. (We realized we were double-counting by adding time estimates to both features/user stories, and the dev tasks they contained.)</p>
<p>Another idea that the team decided on for Iteration 3 was the implementation of data graphs, and to finish the full functionality of the doctor's side of the app. While there was initial struggle with implementation of the data charts, the team figured out how to implement the data charts with proper questioning and research. The overall retrospective for the end of Iteration 2 was smooth as there seemed to be no signs of disagreement on our project direction within the team. One feature that the team decided to drop was the functionality for a patient to check their full log history. We decided as a team that the doctor would be the one to pull up the entire history of logs for a patient. This decision was based on what the team wanted WellSync to be and that was for the healthcare provider to take a greater role in monitoring health outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>While the identity of WellSync was consistent throughout the developmental process, many features/stories simply did not end up fitting the vision of what we had for WellSync. Some functionalities included patients being able to access their logs, patients having a private journal, patients setting goals as well as patients receiving notifications. As these features would have been helpful, WellSync was designed to be more for enabling quick and fast communication between the healthcare provider and their patients. This is definitely not something we want to throw away for future purposes, which is why we've decided to put those features on hold for future iterations.</p>
<p>One lesson that was learned about the large project development was the aspect of effectively communicating. Often times, an issue would arise primarily because of not communicating well or enough. Whether that be saying what time is good to meet or what work needs to be delegated, communication is still considered a large aspect to group projects and team settings. Another lesson for the team was that sometimes the best solution in theory may not be the best solution for the team. Some solutions may be too resource heavy or not feasible for the team. When that situation occurs, the team needs to step up and adjust accordingly. In Iteration 0, a team member spoke up and mentioned how they were not comfortable with being a lead coder, so the team adjusted and was able to complete tasks more effectively by re-assigning work accordingly. Overall, this project has been a wonderful experience for the team as it provides the community with an app that can be used as well as providing team members with experience on software engineering team projects.</p>
